# SERD_MODEL
This repository will contain all the code for the SERD model.

## Brief overview:
The SERD model is a descrete space-time representation emergent from a philosophical first principle concerning the existance of dimensions within 'nothingness'.
In this model space-time is represented as an interconnected network of matter particles separated by edges called 'Interaction Edges' (IE). An IE is a collection of smaller objects called 'Space Elements' (SE), these are the fundermental units of space that make up the proportionate sizes of objects and distances between points in space.
SEs may duplicate (become two SE) or reduce (dissapear) though any incremental change in global time. When this happens a bit of information is created that propagates bi-directionally through the network as the system evolves. 
The system may be considered to be a 'multiway system' as there are many possible branches of state paths that the system may take.
The nodes represent the constiuent parts of matter particles. 
As the space changes the nodes appear to change location, this is space itself changing and not that the nodes are moving through space. 
Therefore the system is 'background independent'. 
We give these nodes the name 'Point Particles' (PP).
PPs have a unique perspective on the system since the information of the substitution rules that has propagated through the network is updated on them. 
In this sence all PPs and SEs are endowed with some level of primative 'awareness' of the system around them. Fron this 'awareness' the dynamic information propagation mechanism is emergent. This is where photon-like information packets emerge out the information corresponding to occured duplcations and reductions and therefore the structure of space-time.
An 'observation is made when a specific observed state is realised when a given PP or collection of PPs is made aware of a change.
PPs may also split (become two PPs with an SE inbetween) or merge (two PPs become one).  
These update rules result in a number of things: Propagating structural bifurcations (PSB), multi-IEs, self loops as well as internal PP structure. (The precise code for this is yet to be created).
A PSB is a bifurcation in an IE that occurs in each IE that a PP that has undergone a split is connected to. It propagates one SE along the IE in each TS of global time.
In this way the SERD model is a network of propagating information, where information relating to the update rules propagates along the edges and is updated on the nodes that behave like the observers of the system. This results in the emergence of event horizons and light-cone constrained dynamics.
Coordinatization can be applied to the system via a stain minimization algorithm which iteratively relaxes the state once every time step, attempting to approach a state of minimum curviature within the number of dimensions that the system exists within.

## The single IE system
In the single IE system we are looking at the behaviour of just one string of SEs and how they evolve.
If this system is a representation of the universe then this system represents interactions between all matter particles and accross all of space.
It also describes the general growth rate of the system/universe.
In this system the state (or microstate) of the system at a given point in time can be represented by a simple natural number describing the number of SEs in the IE. 
However, this would be infact two numbers since there is the observed state, the number of SEs that the enclosing PP is aware of due to the propagating information that has reached it, and a hidden state, the number of SEs that actually exist in the IE.
In the case of the universe it is likely that the hidden state is much larger than the observed state since the universe is expanding.

What we are showing with this experiment presented here is evidence that the size of the observable universe is constrained by its age.
We measure the time it takes for infromation to propagate accross the IE and average it at the point of measurement, this gives us the expected update time. Then we compare that to the observed size of the IE. We aim to show that with sufficient scaling that these two values tend to become equal. In other words, the observed size of the universe is contained by the speed of light, which in this scale is just 1 even when the true rate of expansion is considerably greater.
We are considering an IE connecting our central position of observation and either distant galaxies or the edge of our observable universe, and therefore it's expansion rate should be correlated to that of our universe, if the model has physical comparability.
