# SERD_MODEL
This repository will contain all the code for the SERD model.

## Brief overview:
The SERD model is a descrete space-time representation emergent from a philosophical first principle concerning the existance of dimensions within 'nothingness'.
In this model space-time is represented as an interconnected network of matter particles separated by edges called 'Interaction Edges' (IE). An IE is a collection of smaller objects calle 'Space Elements' (SE), these are the fundermental units of space that make up the proportionate sizes of objects in space.
SEs may duplicate (become two SE) or reduce (dissapear) though any incremental change in time. When this happens a bit of information is created that propagated bidirectionally through the network as the system evolves. 
The system may be considered to be a 'multiway system' as there are many possible branches that the system may take.
The nodes represent the constiuent parts of matter particles. 
As the space changes the nodes appear to change location, this space itself changing and not that the nodes are moving through space. 
Therefore the system is 'background independent'. 
We give these nodes the name 'Point Particles' (PP).
PPs have a perspective on the system since the information of the undate substitution rules that has propagated through the network is updated on them. 
In this sence all PPs are endowed with some level of promative 'awareness' of the system around them.
An 'observation is made when a specific branch is realised when a given PP or collection of PPs is made aware of a change.
PPs may also split (become two PPs with an SE inbetween) or merge (two PPs become one). 
These update rules result in a number of things: Propagating structural bifurcations, multi-IEs, self loops as well as internal PP structure. (The precise code for this is yet to be created).
In this way the SERD model is a network of propagating information, where information relating to the update rules propagates along the edges and is updated on the nodes that behave like the observers of the system.

## The single IE system
In the single IE system we are looking at the behaviour of just one string of SEs and how they evolve.
If this system is a representation of the universe then this system represents interactions between all matter particles.
It also describes the general growth rate of the system.
In this system the state (or microstate) of the system at a given point in time can be represented by a simple natural number describing the number of SEs in the IE. 
However, this would be infact two numbers since there is the observed state, the number of SEs that the enclosing PP is aware of due to the propagating information that has reached it, and a hidden state, the number of SEs that actually exist in the IE.
In the case of the universe it is likely that the hidden state is much larger than the observed state since the universe is expanding.

What we are showing with this experiment presented here is evidence that the size of the observable universe is constrained by its age.
How do we do that?
